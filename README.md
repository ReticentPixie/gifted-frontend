# Gifted   [![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/df0076cd-4b10-4180-bed3-75b0c917df78/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/gifted-react-app/deploys)
Gifted is a gift tracking and organization app designed to make it simple for users to know exactly what they've given to their love ones over time. Gifted is a full-stack MERN application built to solve a hurdle I encounter every year...avoiding duplicative gifts to my many nieces and nephews. With a user-friendly React frontend supported by a powerful Express API (checkout the backend [here](https://github.com/ReticentPixie/gifted-api)), Gifted simplifies gift tracking and makes organization simple and fun. For added security and piece of mind, Gifted utilizes [Google Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) authentication on both the front and back end.

# Planning & Production
Gifted was created utilizing the power [Create React App](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html#create-react-app) environment to springboard initial app creation. Planning stages utilized [InVision](https://diana178050.invisionapp.com/freehand/Gifted-Wire-Frames-pu9As7Dmx) to sketch wireframes, [Lucidchart](https://lucid.app/lucidchart/b878e861-1182-49ac-877c-600350c0c60a/edit?viewport_loc=204%2C-67%2C1701%2C1483%2C0_0&invitationId=inv_6b4c5476-0028-4889-ba5a-72fe7f47e707) to create ERD, and [Trello](https://trello.com/b/JsfdVfSC/seir-project-3#) for project planning.
